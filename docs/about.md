::: danger Interest
Web 3D - I am very optimistic about the future development of 3D, and there will be many application scenarios in the future. On the one hand, mobile applications will gradually become 3D, and the interaction will be more realistic. On the other hand, many 3D software will easily attract users' attention. Of course, all of this requires technical support.

Web 3 - Web 3 is a broad term. But based on decentralization, many new ways of collaboration may emerge. So I have been keeping an eye on this direction, and I think there will be a lot of new opportunities here.

Finance - I love finance and investing, it's a very interesting industry and it's a lot of fun fighting with people. But I am a relatively conservative investor, I donâ€™t like high-risk investments, and I like fixed investment the most.
